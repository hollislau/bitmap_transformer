# Bitmap Transformer
This command line application will read a bitmap (non-palette bitmap of any size) from the project root directory and write to a new bitmap file with either a grayscale or inverted color transformation applied to it. To use this app, run `bin/bmt [bitmap] [grayscale/inverted]`.
